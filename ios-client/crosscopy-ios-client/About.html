        <strong>cross copy</strong> was build to do something against the ever 
        remaining problems when it comes to quick file transfer between devices. Of course
        there are many other tools helping you to put stuff into the cloud already.
        But none was satisfying our need when it comes to simplicity and spontaneity.<br />
        
        This Tool is completely Open Source and hosted on 
        <a href="https://github.com/rodja/cross-copy">GitHub</a>. The server API is very simple
        and we would love to see it used as a sharing mechanism in other applications.
